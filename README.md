# RL-Exploration

A location to explore and exercise RL techiniques.

## Ideas/To-Do

~1) Bellmann implementation of vaccine delivery for single site with infinite resources.~
2) Model-free implementation of vaccine delivery for single site with infinite resources.
3) Model-free implementation of vaccine delivery for two sites with infinite resources.
4) Model-free implementation of vaccine delivery for two sites with limited resources.
    1) Limited number of vaccines
        1) Constrained vaccine production rate (i.e. vaccines generated from Gaussian?)
        2) Limited warehousing of vaccines
    2) Different buying powers for each centre
5) Model-free implementation with the demand regulated by R-number.
